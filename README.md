# Important Note
I promised to release the code for the paper, but before doing so I moved to industry. Hence I did not have time to prepare a clean implementation of the paper. But due to the interest from the comunity I am releasing the code for the paper, [HERE](https://github.com/meysamsadeghi/Security-and-Robustness-of-Deep-Learning-in-Wireless-Communication-Systems/tree/master/Adv_Attack_Modulation_Classification/dirty_old_implementation). Unfortunately, the code is **OLD**, **dirty** and looks like a hack. So please bear with it.


I try to update the code and provide a nice, readble, and easy to develop one in future, without any promis on the delivery date.

Thank you for your interest.
